# AlgosP1Princeton
Repository with my course materials and solutions for the Coursera course "Algorithms, Part 1" from Princeton University.

I'm followint this course to complement on my univeristy class Estructuras de Datos, which follows the book written by the course proffessors.

There is a package, called algs4.jar, which we use in the course. By following some instructions, it is possible to create the commands javac-algs4 and java-algs4 to compile and execute programs which make use of this package.
